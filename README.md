## Git vs. GitHub

##### What is git?
Git is _version control software_ that helps you save your work. It allows you to save your changes as you progress and you can refer back to any version of your work whenever you want. Unlike Github, git runs locally. Meaning that the work you do on git is only saved on your device. Git also does not need Github to run in order to work.
##### What is github?
Github is where you save your repository. Unlike git, github requires git in order to run. Github also runs in the cloud where you can save all your changes without having to worry about losing them. You can use github to work with others on the same project simultaneously without affcting eachother's work. You can also see your changes in order and return your project to an older version if you decide to do so.
